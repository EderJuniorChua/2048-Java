# 2048-Java
2nd Term Freshman project, 2048 in Java

Hi, this is my project for Programming 2, It's quite a challenge building this as 
I built it with multiple classes instead of one, while advance studying about inheritance and played a bit with abstraction.

The game is console based and can be run in the Main Class

2048 was originally made by https://gabrielecirulli.com/ with inspiration from threes

You can tinker with the program, and any feedback is appreciated!
